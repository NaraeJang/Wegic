# Wegic

Introducing WEGIC Mobile Wedding Invitation, a delightful UI/UX project I worked on for a Korean-Canadian couple entering the Canadian wedding market. Mobile wedding invitations have gained popularity due to their convenience, cost-effectiveness, environmental consciousness, technological integration, customization options, and social media compatibility. Inspired by this trend, my clients sought to establish a small business offering digital invitations.

As a UI/UX Designer, I collaborated closely with my clients to gather user requirements, analyze competitors' offerings, and develop the mobile invitation structure. I created and refined paper wireframes, which then served as the basis for digital wireframes. Designing high-fidelity UI prototypes, I ensured seamless user flows through user testing.

During a two-week coding challenge, I brought the WEGIC Mobile Wedding Invitation to life. The resulting design is fully responsive across various mobile devices. Notable features include a dynamic calendar, D-day countdown, and the ability to save data and leave comments for the couple using local storage.
